# Fortune favours the bold

## Caveats

I wrote this as a static site before looking at the PeopleList Repo. I included PeopleList under server and enabled cors.
jQuery is the only dep.


## To Run
From /server
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

From root:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

`http://0.0.0.0:3001`

## Testing
- `npm install`
- `npm test`

## Coverage (100%)
- `npm install`
- `npm run coverage`

Wouldn't usually commit the coverage.html file but in this case did to save you generating it.
Wouldn't usually commit dist.
