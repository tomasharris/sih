# Github API

## Caveats

jQuery is the only dep. Unfortunately I ran out of time to write tests for this one.


## To Run
From root:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

`http://0.0.0.0:3001`

## Testing
- `npm install`
- `npm test`

## Coverage
- `npm install`
- `npm run coverage`

Wouldn't usually commit the coverage.html file but in this case did to save you generating it.
Wouldn't usually commit dist.
